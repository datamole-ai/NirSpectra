The data for this assignment consists of the following columns (in this particular order):

- Sample number.
- The quantity to predict.
- The rest of the columns are the spectral data.

**Your task:**

- Perform an exploratory analysis of the data.
- Develop a predictive model for the second column and report its accuracy in terms of R-squared and RMSE error.
- Explain your model.

We suggest you to use Jupyter notebook for this assignment.
